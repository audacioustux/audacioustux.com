In short,

zalgo text: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work
extra: http://archives.miloush.net/michkap/archive/2010/04/28/10002896.html

the problem: is in the thumbnail

there might be many solution, but none of them really works all the time. just
removing diacritics or combine characters won't solve the problem. and striping
or Modifying user submitted text should have strong reasons. this is not one of
them. imagine if Stack overflow sanitized the content of that question, OP would
have to submit a screenshot to describe the **thing**

solution:

```css
display: block; // overflow: hidden won't work otherwise
overflow: hidden;
```

set this for `<p><span>` or whatever
and set line-height as needed, as much you want to be visible

and also you may want to set overflow: visible on :hover

now, let pips do whatever they want.. like using username/handle: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
