* what's programming language, and why?
* `x` Language Best
    - readability / syntax / paradigm
    - speed / resource ratio
    - ecosystem, community
    - learning curve
    - debug
    - fault tolerance, scalability, concurrency
    - modularity
    - platform
    - use case
* state of tech stack
* `functional, oop, procedural/imperative`
* debunk myths
* jvm/beam, GC, JIT, memory layout
* why learn 69 languages
    - thinking in different paradigm & perspective
* for beginners
